cordova-plugin-app-scope
========================

This plugin permits registering the application as a handler for a URL scope, and remapping URLs within that scope to the application bundle. This allows for deep linking from web URLs into the application using [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/ios/universal-links/) on iOS and [App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/) on Android.

This plugin is compatible with [cordova-plugin-code-push](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-code-push).


Installation
------------

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-app-scope
```


Supported Platforms
-------------------

* iOS
* Android


Usage
-----

This plugin will take an HTTPS URL scope, and translate any URL within that scope into a local path to within the application bundle. For example, if the scope were defined as `https://example.com/myapp/` and the app were asked to load `https://example.com/myapp/products/index.html`, it would rewrite the URL to point to the bundled www files of the Cordova application. In this example on Android, it would result in `file:///android_asset/www/products/index.html`.

The URL scope **must** be HTTPS, and needs to be defined in config.xml as a preference with the name `"Scope"`:

```
<preference name="Scope" value="https://example.com/myapp/" />
```

In addition to rewriting URLs when loaded in the Cordova application, the plugin will also attempt to register the application as a system-wide handler for URLs matching the scope. This requires some additional server-side configuration at the website matching the URL scope:

* iOS: [Setting Up an App's Associated Domains](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/setting_up_an_app_s_associated_domains)
* Android: [Verify Android App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-site-associations)

The plugin will take care of setting up the Associated Domains entitlements for iOS and the Intent filters for Android, but you must set up the `assetlinks.json` and `apple-app-site-association` files on the web server.


### JavaScript API

This plugin exposes no API to the application.
